# Ludum Dare - My LibGDX Setup

To prepare for future [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com) events, 
I created this repository of some starting code using Java and 
the [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) framework.

The structure includes functionality to use:  
  * [Scene2D](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Scene2d) for user interface
  * [Box2D](https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D) for entity physics
  * [Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley) for entity-component-system control

The base code includes an Assets.java file to simplify loading and using game assets such as images and sounds.

There are also some sample game files from my Ludum Dare 37 attempt. The files include some game 
data files, collision detection, and other basic guides for future projects.
